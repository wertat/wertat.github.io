## Empty List by slicing is possible. But accessing by index is impossible.
```python
list = []
list[0:3] # possible!
list[0] # => error occurs!
```

## The remove() method removes the first occurrence of the element with the specified value.
```python
list = [1,1,2,2,3]
list.remove(1)
list.remove(1)
```
call remove(1) method two times to remove all '1' element
